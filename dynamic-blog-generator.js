CRITICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
1. NO fictional quotes or made-up people - use only:
   - General industry wisdom (e.g., "Financial advisors often recommend...")
   - Statistical insights (e.g., "Data shows that 73% of borrowers...")
   - Expert consensus (e.g., "Industry analysis indicates...")
   - Your analytical voice without attribution

2. USE ONLY VERIFIED DATA:
   - Current ${calculatorType} rates: ${context.marketData.rates.thirtyYear} (30-year), ${context.marketData.rates.fifteenYear} (15-year)
   - Rate change from last week: ${context.marketData.weeklyChange}
   - Rate trend: ${context.marketData.trend}
   - Data date: ${context.marketData.rates.dataDate}
   - Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

3. LIABILITY COMPLIANCE:
   - Include: "This analysis is for educational purposes. Consult qualified professionals for personal advice."
   - Use conditional language: "may," "could," "potentially," "generally"
   - Focus on education and analysis, not prescriptive advice

CREATIVE CONSTRAINTS (to ensure uniqueness):

FORBIDDEN PATTERNS from previous articles:
${forbiddenPatterns.length > 0 ? forbiddenPatterns.map(p => `   - "${p}"`).join('\n') : '   - None yet'}

STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENT - Use THIS specific structure:
${this.getUniqueStructure(calculatorType)}

WRITING STYLE BREAKERS:
- NEVER start sentences with: "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Indeed," "Nevertheless," "In conclusion"
- AVOID predictable paragraph transitions
- NO three-item lists unless backed by specific data
- VARY sentence length dramatically (mix 5-word sentences with 30-word ones)
- Include unexpected analogies from non-financial contexts
- Break the "wall of text" with varied formatting

TODAY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Your FIRST paragraph must reference something that happened THIS WEEK
- Include: "As of ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}, ..."
- Explain why THIS SPECIFIC WEEK matters for ${calculatorType} decisions
- Compare current rates to: 7 days ago (${context.marketData.weeklyChange} change), and 1 year ago
- End with: "What to do in the next 7 days based on this analysis"

SEO REQUIREMENTS:
- Include the phrase "${calculatorType} calculator" naturally 2-3 times
- Use these related keywords naturally: ${context.seoKeywords.join(', ')}
- Create scannable sections with descriptive H2/H3 headers
- Front-load the most important information in the first paragraph
- Write a compelling meta description (155 characters) at the end

MANDATORY ARTICLE SECTIONS (minimum word counts):
1. Today's Market Reality (200 words)
   - Open with this week's most important development
   - Current ${calculatorType} rates and what changed
   - Why this matters RIGHT NOW

2. Three Detailed Scenarios (500 words)
   - Use these calculations: ${context.calculations}
   - Show how this week's rates affect each scenario
   - Include specific dollar amounts and timeframes

3. Hidden Opportunities This Week (400 words)
   - What the rate ${context.marketData.trend} trend creates
   - Specific strategies that work in ${context.seasonalFactors}
   - Time-sensitive advantages

4. Regional/Demographic Variations (300 words)
   - How high-cost vs. low-cost areas differ
   - Age-based strategy differences
   - Income level considerations

5. Common Mistakes in Current Market (300 words)
   - What worked 6 months ago but doesn't now
   - Misconceptions about current ${calculatorType} market
   - Real cost of waiting vs. acting

6. Your Next 7 Days Action Plan (300 words)
   - Day 1-2: What to research/calculate
   - Day 3-4: Who to contact and what to ask
   - Day 5-7: Decisions to make
   - Include: "Use our ${calculatorType} calculator to run your scenarios"

Total: 2,000+ words of dense, valuable content

UNIQUE ANGLE FOR THIS ARTICLE:
${this.getDataDrivenAngle(calculatorType, context)}

VOICE: ${this.getSafeVoiceRequirement()}

TITLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Include current rate (${context.marketData.rates.thirtyYear}) or rate change (${context.marketData.weeklyChange})
- Make it newsworthy and specific to this week
- Avoid generic phrases like "Ultimate Guide" or "Everything You Need"
- Create urgency without clickbait

BEFORE WRITING, CONFIRM YOU UNDERSTAND:
1. Today's date is ${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long', year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })}
2. Current ${calculatorType} rate is ${context.marketData.rates.thirtyYear}
3. This article will be outdated in 7 days - write accordingly
4. Readers need to make decisions THIS WEEK
5. Generic advice = failure. Specific, timely analysis = success
